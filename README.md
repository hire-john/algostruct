# Algostruct

Algostruct is a simple command line program that demonstrates implementations of various ALGOrithms and Data STRUCTures in the C programming language by developer John McDonnell. Algostruct will really have no actual practical use-value other than allowing potential prospective employers to get a better insight into the developers skills, capabilites, experience, and, thought process. All Algorithms, Data Strutures, and Application code are original implementations by John McDonnell of existing concepts from various technical fields (Mathematics, Computer Science Etc). 

## Development of this project

Community Contributions, commits/pull requests are not accepted as this is simply a side-project that will be developed at will in-lieu of the maintainers (john@hire-john.com) freetime. Commits will be added as each section is completed and some will be added sporadically. 

I generally dedicate an entire day to completeing one single algorithm or data structure depending on complexity. Sometimes I will be able to complete more than one per day and some may take more than one day. I am not racing a clock in developing these and am using the experience to derive as much learning value as possible. There will also be able time dedicated to the programs code as well. I will be trying to utilize industry best practices in writing that as well as taking the opporuntiy to explore C to the greatest extent possible. 

The program contains/will contain the following algortihms and structures and some additions not listed like graphs.

## ALGOrithms

* Sorting Algorithms
** Selection Sort
** Insertion Sort
** Bubble Sort
** Merge Sort
** Quick Sort 
** Heap Sort
** Tree Sort
** Shell Sort
** Bucket Sort
** Radix Sort
** Counting Sort
** Cube Sort

* Searching Algorithms
** Linear Search
** Binary Search
** Ternary Search 
** Jump Search
** Exponential Search
** Interpolation Search

##  Data STRUCTures

* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash Table
* Skip List
* Singly-Linked List
* Double-Linked List
* Binary Search Tree
* Cartesian Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* B-Tree
* KD Tree
* AVL Tree
* Splay Tree

## Build Environment

* Linux
* VIM (no IDE is used for any of these repos)  
* GNU Compiler Collection -> GCC version 12.1.1
* GNU Debugger -> GDB Version 12.1.1
* GNU Automake -> AM Version 1.16.5 (currently optional - maybe for future use)
* GNU Autoconf -> AC Version 2.71 (currently optional - maybe for future use)
* All C is written and compiled to be in accordance with the C17 standard (gcc -std=c17) nearly everything will compile under C18 as well. I'm just sticking to the more wider known C17 standard at this time.
